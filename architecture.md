# Next.js Learning Platform Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the architecture for a comprehensive Next.js learning platform designed to help junior developers grow into senior engineers, with a focus on enterprise-scale applications. The platform follows modern best practices and enterprise-grade architecture patterns.

## Core Architecture Principles

### 1. Scalability
- Modular component design
- Server-side rendering for performance
- Efficient data fetching with React Server Components
- Optimized asset loading and code splitting

### 2. Type Safety
- Strict TypeScript implementation throughout
- Zod schema validation for form inputs and API responses
- Type-safe database queries with Drizzle ORM

### 3. Performance Optimization
- Edge runtime for API routes where applicable
- Image optimization with next/image
- Incremental Static Regeneration for content pages
- Optimized bundle sizes with tree shaking

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 15+ (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Runtime**: Bun
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4.0 with CSS Variables for dark/light mode
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js
- **Cloud Storage**: Cloudflare Images/Media
- **Deployment**: Vercel, Cloudflare, Bun

## Application Layers

### 1. Presentation Layer
- **UI Components**: Reusable, accessible components with Tailwind CSS
- **Page Templates**: Layout components for consistent UI
- **Client-side State**: React Context for global state management
- **Theme System**: Dark/light mode with CSS variables

### 2. Application Layer
- **Server Actions**: Data mutation and processing
- **API Routes**: RESTful endpoints for data access
- **Authentication Logic**: User session management with NextAuth.js
- **Form Handling**: Type-safe form validation and submission

### 3. Domain Layer
- **Business Logic**: Core application rules and workflows
- **Service Layer**: Reusable business operations
- **Data Transformation**: DTOs for API responses and requests

### 4. Data Access Layer
- **Drizzle ORM**: Type-safe database queries
- **Schema Definitions**: Database table structures
- **Migrations**: Database version control
- **Seeders**: Initial data population
